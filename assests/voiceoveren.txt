When there is the chance to make a choice, make one that you know you won't regret...
What kind of a life would I have lived if I didn't choose to board the Express... No, there is no such possibility.

Just like me, the people of Belobog are also seeing the native sky of this planet for the first time.
The seed of Preservation has always been within Belobog, and I simply re-ignited this city's will to live... That will may be weak, but this was not the time for it to go out.
This is our chance.
Stay alert.
Let's go.
Let's make it quick.
Who's next?
Batter up!
Take this!
Rules are made to be broken!
You're out!
You've outstayed your welcome!
Decisive strike!
Keep at it.
Just a scratch.
It'll take more than that.
Much better.
So this is... defeat...
One more at bat.
Reach the end of the story in your own way.
Looks good.
So that's how it works...
We need a strategy.
It's getting late. Where to now?
